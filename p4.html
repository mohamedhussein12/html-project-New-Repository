Fetch:
An instruction and the necessary data are obtained from memory.

</ul>
Decode:
The instruction and data are separated, and the components and pathways required to execute the instruction are activated.

Execute:
The instruction is performed, the data is manipulated, and the results are stored.

This pattern is typically implemented by separating the task into two components, the control, and the datapath.
The control unit reads the instruction, and activates the appropriate parts of the datapath.
</body>

The datapath is the route of the microprocessor. The command buttons of the control unit allow the data to be manipulated in specific, as the data move in multiple parts of the datapath according to the instructions. The data path includes the data transformation loop and the provisional data storage system. It involves ALUs which can convert data through the addition, subtraction, logic AND, OR, reversal and modification
The memory of Harvard's Architecture based  computer system is divided into two

These two parts are:
Information 
 Instructions

 The two distinct memories occupy distinct memory modules in a pure Harvard system, and instructions can only be performed from the memory of the instructions.

Many DSPs are modified Harvard architectures, designed to simultaneously access three distinct memory areas: the program instructions, the signal data samples, and the filter coefficients (often called the P, X, and Y memories).

Modern Computers The recent variants, though with "Harvard-like" features, are nonetheless non-Harvard pcs, especially Intel x86-based ISA-based pcs. The same RAM areas contain all information, program guidelines and data. However, a modern feature called "pages" allows physical memory to be segmented into "pages" large memory blocks. Each page may be directions or information but not both.

Modern embedded computers, however, are usually focused on Harvard architecture. Instructions are placed in a different memory compartment and the microprocessor has no manner of exchanging information and directions.
