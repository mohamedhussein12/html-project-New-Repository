types of computer architecture 
<br>
1. Von-Neumann Architecture
<br>

There is a bus (address bus/data bus/control bus) used for the instruction and data code execution. Input device takes data or instruction and the Central processing unit (CPU) performs one operation at a time, either fetching data or instruction in/out of the memory. Once the operation is done it is sent to the output device. Control and logic units for processing operations are within the central processing unit

2. Harvard Architecture
<br>
Harvard architecture is used when data and code is present in different memory blocks. A separate memory block is needed for data and instruction. Data can be accessed by one memory location and instruction can be accessed by a different location. It has data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit (CPU). A single set of clock cycles is required. The pipeline is possible. It is complex to design. CPU can read and write instructions and process data access. Harvard architecture has different access codes and data address spaces that is, the instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero. Instruction address zero identifies 24-byte value and data address zero identifies 8-byte value which is not the part of the 24-byte value.

3. Instruction Set Architecture
<br>
To make up the architecture, instruction set architecture is needed because it has a set of instructions that the processor understands. It has two instruction set one is RISC (reduced instruction set computer) and the second is CISC (complex instruction set computer).
<br>

Reduced instruction set computer architecture was realized in the 90â€™s by IBM. Instruction has multiple address modes, but programs do not use all of them that is the reason multiple address modes were reduced. This helps the compiler to easily write the instructions, performed is increased.
<br>

Complex instruction set architecture is the root of compilers because earlier compilers were not there to write programs, to ease programming instructions are added. The best performance is obtained by using simple instruction from ISA
<br>
4. Microarchitecture
<br>
Microarchitecture is known as computer organizations and it is the way when instruction set architecture is a built-in processor. Instruction set architecture is implemented with various microarchitecture and it varies because of changing technology.
<br>

Microarchitecture performs in a certain way. It reads the instruction and decodes it, will find parallel data to process the instruction and then will process the instruction and output will be generated.
<br>

It is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers. Some architectures overlap multiple instructions while executing but this does not happen in microarchitecture. Execution units like arithmetic logic units, floating-point units, load units, etc are needed and it performs the operation of the processor. There are microarchitecture decisions within the system such as size, latency, and connectivity of the memories.
<br>
<br>

5. System Design
<br>

The name defines itself, the design will satisfy user requirements such as architecture, module, interfaces and data for a system and it is connected to product development. It is the process of taking marketing information and creating product design to be manufacture. Modular systems are made by standardizing hardware and software.
