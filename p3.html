In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.[1] In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.
Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system. The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors. More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs, since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as the x86 Loop instruction)However, longer and more complex instructions take longer for the processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively. The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions interact in unexpected ways.

The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling. Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic design, and packaging.

Computer architects must design a computer to meet functional requirements
as well as price, power, performance, and availability goals. summarizes requirements to consider in designing a new computer. Often, architects
also must determine what the functional requirements are, which can be a major
task. The requirements may be specific features inspired by the market. Application software often drives the choice of certain functional requirements by determining how the computer will be used. If a large body of software exists for a
certain instruction set architecture, the architect may decide that a new computer
