Computer engineering (CE) is a branch of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering (or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture.
Computer systems fall into essentially two separate categories. The first, and most obvious, is that of the desktop computer. When you say “computer” to someone, this is the machine that usually comes to her mind. The second type of computer is the embedded computer, a computer that is integrated into another system for the purposes of control and/or monitoring. Embedded computers are far more numerous than desktop systems, but far less obvious. Ask the average person how many computers he has in his home, and he might reply that he has one or two. In fact, he may have 30 or more, hidden inside his TVs, VCRs, DVD players, remote controls, washing machines, cell phones, air conditioners, game consoles, ovens, toys, and a host of other devices.
Both have a processor, memory, and often several forms of input and output. The primary difference lies in their intended use, and this is reflected in the system design and their software. Desktop computers can run a variety of application programs, with system resources orchestrated by an operating system. By running different application programs, the functionality of the desktop computer is changed. One moment, it may be used as a word processor; the next it is an MP3 player or a database client. Which software is loaded and run is under user control.
In contrast, the embedded computer is normally dedicated to a specific task. In many cases, an embedded system is used to replace application-specific electronics. The advantage of using an embedded microprocessor over dedicated electronics is that the functionality of the system is determined by the software, not the hardware. This makes the embedded system easier to produce, and much easier to evolve, than a complicated circuit.

What do you mean by computer architecture?
 Computer architecture in computer engineering is a collection of laws and techniques describing software systems features, organisation, and execution. Some architecture terms describe it as defining a computer's capacities and programming model, but not a specific execution.
